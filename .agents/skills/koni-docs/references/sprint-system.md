# Sprint System — Conventions & Workflow

## Naming conventions (canonical — single source of truth for sprint artifact IDs)

| Artifact | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Story file | `US-<EPIC>.<N>[.<SUB>]-<slug>.md` | `US-3.7-pod-project-management.md` |
| Story `id:` frontmatter | `US-<EPIC>.<N>[.<SUB>]` | `US-3.7` |
| Task ID (inside story) | `TASK-<US-id>.<n>` | `TASK-3.7.1` |
| Epic file | `EPIC-<N>.md` or `EPIC-DS.md` | `EPIC-3.md` |
| Sprint file | `sprint-YYYY-WNN.md` | `sprint-2026-W19.md` |

## Story status flow

```
backlog → ready → in-progress → review → done
                      ↓
                   blocked  ← document reason in Implementation notes
```

> **Project rule — Senti Quant (release-gated `done`, [CONTEXT D126](../../../../docs/CONTEXT.md), extends [D124](../../../../docs/CONTEXT.md)):** under the two-phase versioning policy, **`done` means shipped in a released `VERSION`** — not merely "code complete". A story whose work is finished but still sits in CHANGELOG `## [Unreleased]` (no `version_shipped` yet) stays at **`review`**; it flips to **`done`** only when the release is cut and `version_shipped` is set (bare semver). So: `review` = work complete, awaiting release; `done` = shipped. **Exception:** non-shipping meta/governance trackers that never enter the CHANGELOG version stream — e.g. EPIC-37 "Test & QA Coverage" stories (`commit: pending`, `version_shipped` intentionally empty, refreshed by `/run-test`) — are `done` when their work is complete.

**WIP limit**: at most **3 stories** `in-progress` simultaneously **by default**.

The limit is team-configurable via the `Koni-Docs Integration` block in
`CLAUDE.md`:

```yaml
koni-docs:
  agile:
    wip_limit: 3      # default 3; raise for atomic-ship sprints, lower for strict flow
```

When unset, the convention defaults to 3 (best for solo / small teams).
Larger teams may raise to 5–7. Atomic single-session ships (e.g.
agent-assisted sprints that close everything in one commit) sometimes
exceed the limit transiently — `npx koni-docs status` flags WIP violations
but does not block.

**`done` requires**: `version_shipped` set + CHANGELOG entry exists + all AC `[x]`.

### Hybrid EPIC numbering (BMad legacy + post-koni-docs)

Some Koniverse projects (e.g. senti_quant) carry **zero-padded epic IDs
from the BMad era** (`EPIC-01`..`EPIC-13`) alongside **plain epic IDs
added after koni-docs adoption** (`EPIC-14`+). Both are valid; sync
scripts treat the number as an opaque identifier.

To minimize confusion:

- **New projects**: use plain `EPIC-N` (no zero-padding) for all epics.
- **Migrated projects**: keep existing padded IDs as-is for backward
  compatibility; only new epics need plain numbering. `findEpicFile`
  matches via `startsWith(${id}.)` so file naming must match frontmatter
  `id:` exactly (`EPIC-08.md` ↔ `id: EPIC-08`, not `id: EPIC-8`).
- When `npx koni-docs backfill-fields` infers epic from story id, it emits
  plain `EPIC-N`. On a padded-ID project, hand-correct after backfill.
  Filed as followup for a future story (auto-detect pad-style from
  existing epic files).

## Scripts reference

The `@koniverse/koni-docs` CLI provides all automation. Install once per project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @koniverse/koni-docs
```

| Command | What it does | When to run |
|---|---|---|
| `npx koni-docs status --docs-path docs/` | Regenerate `STATUS.md` from all story frontmatter | Before every commit that changes story status |
| `npx koni-docs sync --docs-path docs/` | Propagate story status upward — updates EPIC table, PRD `Functional Requirements` row, and sprint scope | After story status changes |
| `npx koni-docs inject-tasks --docs-path docs/ --story US-X.Y` | Regenerate Tasks section from Acceptance Criteria (AC is canonical) | When AC changes |
| `npx koni-docs backfill-fields --docs-path docs/` | Backfill `assignee`/`commit`/`sprint` on existing stories | When setting up sprint system in existing project |
| `npx koni-docs backfill-commits --docs-path docs/` | Backfill "pending" commit SHAs in CHANGELOG with real SHAs from git | When SHAs are missing |

All subcommands accept `--dry-run` for safe preview mode.

**Always run `npx koni-docs status` before committing any story status change.**
STATUS.md is auto-generated — never hand-edit it (RULE-5).

## 5-layer consistency check (before merging)

The five layers must be consistent after every story ships. Run `npx koni-docs sync` to propagate automatically.

| Layer | File | What to verify |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Story | `Docs/sprints/stories/US-X.Y-*.md` | `status: done`, `version_shipped` set, all AC + Tasks `[x]` |
| 2 — Epic | `Docs/sprints/epics/EPIC-N.md` | Story row checked off; epic `status` updated if all stories done |
| 3 — PRD | `Docs/PRD.md` | `Functional Requirements` row `✅ shipped (vX.Y.Z)`; `Epics & User Stories` entry `✅ Done (vX.Y.Z)` |
| 4 — Sprint | `Docs/sprints/sprint-YYYY-WNN.md` | Story row shows done + version |
| 5 — STATUS | `Docs/sprints/STATUS.md` | Regenerated by `npx koni-docs status` |

Inconsistency between any two layers = documentation debt. Fix in same commit as the feature.

## Pre-commit checklist

Run through every item before committing:

```
[ ] VERSION bumped per semver rule
[ ] CHANGELOG.md has a new entry — same commit, real SHA, never "pending" (RULE-1, RULE-2)
[ ] PRD.md story status updated if scope changed
[ ] CONTEXT.md has new entry if a decision was made
[ ] SETUP.md + DEPLOY.md + .env.example updated if new env var (RULE-11)
[ ] LESSONS.md has new entry if a trap or pattern was discovered
[ ] Story file: Tasks all [x]; status → review while unreleased (entry under CHANGELOG [Unreleased], no version_shipped), → done only after the release is cut + version_shipped set (release-gated done, CONTEXT D126)
[ ] npx koni-docs sync --docs-path docs/  (propagates AC to EPIC + PRD)
[ ] npx koni-docs status --docs-path docs/  (regenerates STATUS.md — RULE-5)
[ ] CLAUDE.md Active Context block updated (T1-T7 as applicable)
```

## Test artifacts

Per-story Acceptance Criteria (`stories/US-X.Y-<slug>.md` §4) + Verification commands (§11) remain the source of truth for what each individual story must prove. Two additional artifact types capture what AC cannot:

| Artifact | Location | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| Test cases | `docs/tests/test-cases/EPIC-N.md` (one per epic) | End-to-end scenarios spanning ≥2 stories; regression scenarios for cross-story invariants; smoke; coverage matrix (AC → TC) |
| Test report — per-execution | `docs/tests/test-reports/runs/YYYY-MM-DD-EPIC-N-runN.md` | Execution log: who ran which TCs in which env against which commit, pass/fail per TC, failure reproduction detail |
| Test report — per-release | `docs/tests/test-reports/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` | Release-level aggregate of run files; outstanding risks; named ship-decision sign-off |

**Promotion rule** — keep a scenario inside the story file unless one of:

- it spans ≥2 stories in the same epic (E2E),
- it guards an epic-level invariant or past bug (REG),
- it runs on a different cadence than per-PR (smoke / nightly perf / security).

**Test-cases file structure (audience: tester / reviewer)** — every `EPIC-N.md` file follows this 10-section skeleton (see [`templates/test-cases.md`](templates/test-cases.md) §2 Section index):

1. Frontmatter — YAML metadata, no `status`
2. Overview — Scope (paragraph + "Out of scope" bullets)
3. Overview — Stories in scope (table `| Story | Short name | Status |` with emoji)
4. Overview — Goals (3-5 bullets stating high-level invariants the suite proves)
5. Overview — Environment & test data
6. Overview — Cadence & ownership
7. Quick reference — scenarios summary (table `| # | ID | Type | Priority | Short description | Stories | Mode |` — single-row scan of every TC)
8. Test scenarios (H3 per TC with YAML + Gherkin + Preconditions + Test data + Notes)
9. Coverage matrix (table `| Story | AC | AC description | Covered by | Type |` — Story column inlines short name, AC description distills story AC text in ≤80 chars)
10. Open / deferred scenarios

The Stories-in-scope / Goals / Quick-reference triad up front lets a tester understand scope + run sequence in ≤2 minutes without scrolling through Gherkin. The Coverage matrix's inline short name + AC description columns mean each row is self-explanatory — no story-file lookup needed.

**Lifecycle (per-TC, implicit — no frontmatter status)** — `draft` until §Coverage matrix row + `maps_to.ac` are populated → `ready`. Execution state lives only in `test-reports/runs/*.md`. Deprecate by replacing the H3 body with `**Deprecated YYYY-MM-DD** — <reason>` and keeping the ID intact.

**Append-only discipline (reports)** — never edit a past run's results; re-runs create new files (`-run2`, `-run3`, …). A release file's `ship_status` may flip `held → shipped` or `shipped → rolled-back`, recorded as a dated paragraph under §Ship decision. Reports are never deleted.

**Templates**: [`test-cases.md`](templates/test-cases.md) · [`test-report.md`](templates/test-report.md) (two sub-templates: per-execution + per-release).

**Folder READMEs**: [`docs/tests/test-cases/README.md`](../../../docs/tests/test-cases/README.md) · [`docs/tests/test-reports/README.md`](../../../docs/tests/test-reports/README.md).

**Phase 1 is manual-only.** A sync script (`agile-sync-tests.mjs`), a RULE (epic must have test-cases before close), and a Playwright → markdown converter for CI are planned for phase 2 once the manual pattern stabilizes.

## How to set up in a new project

1. Create `Docs/` directory structure per the orientation in SKILL.md §0
2. Add the CLAUDE.md integration block (see `templates.md` §CLAUDE.md)
3. Add the AGENTS.md reference block (see `templates.md` §AGENTS.md)
4. Create initial `VERSION` file (e.g., `0.1.0`)
5. Create initial `CHANGELOG.md` with `[Unreleased]` section
6. If using sprints, create `Docs/sprints/` with `stories/`, `epics/`, `archive/` subdirectories
7. Run `npx koni-docs status` to generate initial STATUS.md
