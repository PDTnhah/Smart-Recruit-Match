# Core Rules — Detailed Reference

> These 12 rules apply to ALL Koniverse projects regardless of technology stack.
> Technology-specific rules live in plugin skills (koni-docs-supabase, koni-docs-nextjs, etc.)

## Rule Groups

| Group | When enforced |
|-------|---------------|
| Pre-commit | Before `git commit` |
| During work | While writing code/docs |
| Post-generation | After running scripts |

---

## Pre-commit Rules

### RULE-1: VERSION + CHANGELOG in same commit

**Severity**: BLOCKER — violations block merge

**What**: Every code-shipping commit must update both the `VERSION` file AND `Docs/CHANGELOG.md` in the SAME commit. Never defer documentation to a follow-up commit.

**Why**: Keeps version tracking and changelog atomically linked to the code change. A follow-up commit can be missed; a `git bisect` won't find the changelog entry.

**How to comply**:
1. Bump `VERSION` file according to semver rules
2. Add new CHANGELOG entry at top (below `[Unreleased]`)
3. Commit both together with the code changes

**Semver rules**:
| Change type | Bump |
|---|---|
| Breaking schema / public API change | MAJOR |
| New backward-compatible feature (default) | MINOR |
| Bug fix, no new feature | PATCH |

**Grep check**: `git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "VERSION|CHANGELOG" | wc -l` — must be 2 when code files are staged.

> **Project override — Senti Quant ([CONTEXT D124](../../../../docs/CONTEXT.md)):** this repo runs a **two-phase** policy that overrides the same-commit `VERSION` bump above. Work commits (feat/fix/refactor/…) add their entry under CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` and do **NOT** bump `VERSION`; the bump happens **once per release** (on request, typically end-of-day — the `dev → main` cut), when `[Unreleased]` entries are moved into a `## [X.Y.Z]` block. The `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` hook enforces this two-phase form (code commit → CHANGELOG entry required; new `## [X.Y.Z]` block → `VERSION` required). RULE-2, RULE-16, and the semver bump rules still apply **at release time**.

**See**: `templates.md` §CHANGELOG entry, §CHANGELOG safe insertion

---

### RULE-2: Commit hash in CHANGELOG mandatory

**Severity**: BLOCKER

**What**: Every CHANGELOG entry must end with `**Commit**: <7-char SHA>`. The SHA must be real — `pending` is NEVER acceptable.

**Why**: Allows `git log --grep` to find which commit shipped which version. A placeholder SHA breaks bisectability and erodes trust.

**How to comply**:
1. Write the CHANGELOG entry with all content
2. Commit everything
3. Note the 7-char SHA from `git log -1 --format=%h`
4. `git commit --amend` to fill in the SHA
5. Push

**Grep check**: `grep -n "Commit.*pending" Docs/CHANGELOG.md` — must return empty.

**See**: `templates.md` §CHANGELOG entry

---

### RULE-11: New env var → update all three files

**Severity**: BLOCKER

**What**: Adding a new environment variable requires updating ALL three files in the same commit: `Docs/SETUP.md` + `DEPLOY.md` + `.env.example`.

**Why**: A missing env var in SETUP.md blocks new developers. Missing in DEPLOY.md causes production outages. Missing in .env.example makes it undiscoverable.

**How to comply** — all three in same commit:
1. `Docs/SETUP.md` — add to the `.env.local` example block + one-line description
2. `DEPLOY.md` — add to the production env vars table
3. `.env.example` — add the key with placeholder value

**Format for .env.example**:
```bash
# <Category / Feature name> (added in vX.Y.Z)
# <One sentence: what this controls, where to get the value>
NEW_ENV_VAR=<placeholder_or_description>
```

**Format for SETUP.md env block**:
```markdown
# <Category name> (added in vX.Y.Z)
# <What it does — 1 line>
NEW_ENV_VAR=<example_value_or_instructions>
```

**See**: `templates.md` §SETUP.md + DEPLOY.md + .env.example

---

### RULE-14: Commit message prefix

**Severity**: WARNING

**What**: Every commit message must use a conventional prefix: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`.

**Why**: Enables automatic changelog generation and makes `git log --oneline` scannable by intent.

**Note**: Doc-only commits (typo, formatting) do NOT bump VERSION.

---

## During-Work Rules

### RULE-6: Story ID must match across all docs

**Severity**: BLOCKER

**What**: A story's `id:` in frontmatter must exactly match:
1. The filename prefix (e.g., `US-3.7` in `US-3.7-pod-project-management.md`)
2. The PRD §7 entry identifier

One canonical ID per story across all documentation layers.

**Why**: Prevents ID drift between the story file, the sprint board, and the PRD. Mismatched IDs break the 5-layer consistency system.

**How to comply**:
1. Before creating a story, check PRD §7 to confirm the ID
2. If the story doesn't exist in PRD §7, add it first
3. Use the exact same ID in filename, frontmatter `id:`, and PRD reference

**Grep check**: `grep -rn "US-X.Y" Docs/sprints/stories/ Docs/PRD.md` — all references to a story ID must be consistent.

**See**: `templates.md` §Story file, `sprint-system.md` §Naming conventions

---

### RULE-7: CONTEXT.md is append-only

**Severity**: BLOCKER

**What**: Never edit or delete a past CONTEXT.md entry. Corrections get a new `D<N> (revision of D<M>)` entry appended at the end of the current phase.

**Why**: The decision log is a historical record. Rewriting history destroys the "why did we choose X?" trail that future contributors depend on.

**How to comply**:
- **Correction needed?** → Append `### D<N>. <Title> (revision of D<M>)` with `What changed`, `New decision`, `Rationale`
- **Wrong entry?** → Add correction entry; never delete the original
- **Missing rationale?** → "because Y" is mandatory in every entry

**Anti-patterns**:
| Wrong | Correct |
|---|---|
| Edit body of past entry D<M> | Add new D<N> (revision of D<M>) |
| Delete a wrong decision | Add correction entry |
| Leave rationale blank | Always include "because Y" |
| One huge entry for 10 decisions | One entry per decision |

**See**: `templates.md` §CONTEXT.md, §CONTEXT revision entry

---

### RULE-10: Mark tasks as you complete them

**Severity**: WARNING

**What**: Mark story Tasks `[x]` individually as each task is completed, not all at once when the story finishes. Same rule applies to Acceptance Criteria checkboxes.

**Why**: Incremental checkmarks give visibility into progress. Batch-marking at the end hides blockers and makes sprint status inaccurate.

**How to comply**: After completing each Task or AC, immediately update its checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]` using the Edit tool.

**See**: `sprint-system.md` §Story status flow

---

### RULE-13: English-only for all deliverables

**Severity**: WARNING

**What**: All code, comments, UI strings, error messages, commit messages, and documentation must be in English. Vietnamese is reserved for user chat prompts only.

**Why**: English is the lingua franca of software. Non-English strings in code or docs create barriers for international contributors and tooling.

---

### RULE-15: `assignee:` is the GitHub login — never git `user.name`, never a display name

**Severity**: BLOCKER

**What**: Every `assignee:` value in koni-docs artifacts MUST be the contributor's **GitHub login** (the `username` half of `github.com/<username>`). Not their git `user.name`. Not their display name. Not their email handle. Same convention everywhere a person is named:

- Story frontmatter `assignee:` (`docs/sprints/stories/US-*.md`)
- Sprint scope-table assignee columns (`docs/sprints/sprint-*.md`)
- Epic frontmatter / sprint frontmatter owner / lead fields (where present)
- `.active-context.md` "Local developer.GitHub login" field
- CONTEXT.md decision authorship (if recorded)
- LESSONS.md attribution (if recorded)

**Why**: GitHub login is the only identifier that survives across **@-mentions, PR reviewer assignments, `gh api users/<login>`, CODEOWNERS lookups, and audit attribution**. Git `user.name` is per-machine and per-developer — one maintainer's `user.name = AnhMTV` while their GitHub login is `saltict`, so a mismatched `assignee:` silently breaks every downstream lookup (PR ping never fires, CODEOWNERS skips them, status reports route to the wrong person).

**How to comply**:
1. **Get your own login**: `gh api user --jq .login` returns it exactly. Copy that string verbatim into `assignee:`.
2. **Get a teammate's login**: prefer the value they already use in past stories or `.active-context.example.md`. Otherwise `gh api users/<guess>` returns HTTP 200 only if `<guess>` is the real login.
3. **Set once, reuse**: write your login to `.active-context.md` `Local developer.GitHub login` field on first checkout. Every subsequent `assignee:` you set in any story copies from there.
4. **Never substitute git config**: `git config user.name` is for commit attribution, not assignee routing. They can disagree, and when they do the GitHub-side wins for every tool that matters.

**Grep checks**:
- Story files using your machine's git `user.name` instead of GitHub login:
  ```bash
  grep -lE "^assignee: $(git config user.name)$" docs/sprints/stories/*.md
  ```
  Should return zero files **unless** your git `user.name` happens to equal your GitHub login.
- Cross-check that every non-empty `assignee:` resolves via `gh`:
  ```bash
  grep -hE "^assignee: \S+$" docs/sprints/stories/*.md | awk '{print $2}' \
    | sort -u | xargs -I{} sh -c 'gh api users/{} > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "{}: ok" || echo "{}: NOT A REAL LOGIN"'
  ```
  Every line should print `ok`.

**See**: `templates/story.md` §1 Frontmatter, `templates/sprint.md` §Sprint scope table, `templates/integration.md` §2 (`.active-context.md` Local developer block).

### RULE-16: `version_shipped:` is bare semver — never `v`-prefixed

**Severity**: BLOCKER

**What**: Every `version_shipped:` value in story frontmatter MUST be **bare semver** — `0.7.0`, NEVER `v0.7.0`. Same rule applies to:
- Story frontmatter `version_shipped:` (`docs/sprints/stories/US-*.md`)
- Repo-root `VERSION` file content (`0.7.0\n`, not `v0.7.0\n`)
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` section anchors (`## [0.7.0]`, not `## [v0.7.0]`)
- Any `version:` / `released_version:` field in epic / sprint / PRD frontmatter

The `v` prefix IS still used for narrative / convention surfaces:
- Git tags (`v0.7.0` — git tradition)
- CHANGELOG narrative titles after the dash chain (`## [0.7.0] — date — title — v0.7.0`)
- Active Context summary lines (`Last Version: v0.7.0`)
- Body prose in stories / decisions / lessons (`shipped in v0.7.0`)

**Why**: Tooling that joins on version strings — `agile-sync-up.mjs` Stories-table writer, CHANGELOG-anchor lookup, semver `compare()`, sort order — needs a single canonical key. Mixing `v0.7.0` and `0.7.0` in structured fields silently breaks equality comparisons and produces double-`v` corruption like `vv0.7.0` in synced output (the script prepends `v` to the bare convention). Real-world trap: caught during Koni-Skills v0.2.0 dogfood when US-1.1's `version_shipped: v0.1.0` produced `vv0.1.0` in EPIC-1 Stories table ([LESSONS §4](LESSONS.md)). Same split that git itself uses: tag `v0.7.0`, but `package.json` `"version": "0.7.0"`.

**How to comply**:
1. **In story frontmatter**: `version_shipped: 0.7.0` — no `v`.
2. **In VERSION file**: bare `0.7.0` (one line, no `v`).
3. **In CHANGELOG section anchors**: `## [0.7.0] — 2026-MM-DD — title — v0.7.0` — `[0.7.0]` is the bare anchor; the trailing `v0.7.0` is narrative.
4. Prose elsewhere uses `v`-prefix freely.

**Grep checks**:
- Story frontmatter no-`v`: `grep -lE '^version_shipped: v' docs/sprints/stories/*.md` → must return zero files.
- VERSION file: `head -1 VERSION | grep -E '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$'` → must match (no `v`).
- CHANGELOG anchors: `grep -E '^## \[v' docs/CHANGELOG.md` → must return zero lines.

**See**: `templates/story.md` §1 Frontmatter, `templates/changelog.md` §template skeleton, [LESSONS §4](../../docs/LESSONS.md).

### RULE-17: Frontmatter ID fields are bare canonical IDs only — never prose

**Severity**: BLOCKER

**What**: Every frontmatter field that holds an ID the tooling will look up — `prd_ref`, `arch_ref`, `depends_on`, `epic`, `sprint`, `version_shipped`, `id` — MUST contain only bare canonical IDs matching the regex for that namespace ([`frontmatter-spec.md`](frontmatter-spec.md) §2). Parenthetical notes, scope qualifiers ("(partial — accept path)"), dependency narratives ("extends US-1.3 …"), version ranges ("FR-28 .. FR-45"), slash-joined IDs ("FR-93 / FR-94"), and cross-namespace mixing (putting `AD-N` into `prd_ref`) are all forbidden.

The canonical YAML form is a **list of strings**: `prd_ref: [FR-04, FR-10]`. The legacy comma-string form (`prd_ref: FR-04, FR-10`) is still accepted by the parser but **must not contain anything except IDs and commas**.

**Why**: `koni-docs sync` reads ID-typed fields, splits CSV strings on `,`, then looks each fragment up in a canonical table (FR row in PRD, story row in epic, etc.). A single qualifier like `FR-94 (shared with EPIC-5)` becomes the literal lookup key `FR-94 (shared with EPIC-5)` — guaranteed table miss, surfaced as a noisy "row not found" warning every sync run. A prose-stuffed value like `ARCH §External Services (Resend, MVP) — proposes AD-33 …` shatters into half-a-dozen junk tokens. This recurring class of bug was diagnosed during the US-4.29 PRD-label cleanup on Koni-Finance-Final's 204-story corpus.

**How to comply**:
1. Use **list form** for every ID-typed field: `prd_ref: [FR-04, FR-10]`.
2. **One namespace per field**: `prd_ref` is FR / NFR only; `arch_ref` is AD only; `depends_on` is US only. See [`frontmatter-spec.md`](frontmatter-spec.md) §3 for the per-document contract.
3. **Prose moves to the body** — Background / Cross-story dependencies / Architecture constraints / Implementation notes. Frontmatter is for tooling; bodies are for humans.
4. **Enumerate ranges** — `[FR-28, FR-29, …, FR-45]`, never `FR-28 .. FR-45`. If the list is unwieldy, the owning epic / story is too broad — split it.
5. When migrating an existing project, run the audit grep from [`frontmatter-spec.md`](frontmatter-spec.md) §6 to surface offenders, then fix per-epic.

**Grep checks**:
- Story `prd_ref` is well-formed (list, flow-list, or pure CSV of IDs):
  ```bash
  rg --no-heading -n '^prd_ref:' docs/sprints/stories | \
    grep -vE '^[^:]+:\s*(\[[A-Z, 0-9-]+\]|\s*$|[A-Z]+-[0-9]+(,\s*[A-Z]+-[0-9]+)*)$'
  ```
  → must return zero matches.
- Same for `arch_ref` and `depends_on` — substitute the field name.
- `koni-docs sync --dry-run` → zero `section "..." not found` / `row with ID="<garbage>" not found` warnings.
- `koni-docs validate` → exits 0.

**See**: [`frontmatter-spec.md`](frontmatter-spec.md) (the authoritative spec — per-field contract, anti-pattern catalog, migration playbook), `templates/story.md` §1 Frontmatter, `templates/epic.md` §1 Frontmatter.

## Post-Generation Rules

### RULE-5: STATUS.md is auto-generated

**Severity**: BLOCKER

**What**: `Docs/sprints/STATUS.md` is auto-generated by `npm run agile:status`. Never hand-edit it.

**Why**: Hand-edits to STATUS.md will be overwritten by the next script run. The file is a derived artifact from story frontmatter — the source of truth is the story files.

**How to comply**: Always run `npm run agile:status` before committing any story status change. If STATUS.md looks wrong, fix the story frontmatter, not STATUS.md.

**Grep check**: N/A — this is a process rule. The script regeneration is the enforcement mechanism.

**See**: `sprint-system.md` §Scripts reference
