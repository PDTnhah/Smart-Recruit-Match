# nfr — non-functional coverage (security-led)

> **Load when**: the **Design** stage of [`qc-workflow.md`](qc-workflow.md) needs
> the non-functional cases that the backup corpus almost entirely lacked (<5%).
> Functional + edge coverage is necessary but not sufficient — a feature that is
> correct can still be insecure, slow, inaccessible, or unobservable. Security
> leads because it is where the highest-blast-radius defects hide.

> Each section is a tight checklist plus a **required when** risk trigger. Apply a
> section only when its trigger fires — not every feature needs every category.

## Security

The lead, and the **shortlist + trigger** only. The threat model, the per-category
case-derivation taxonomy, the adversarial identify→refute→confidence-filter review, the
finding schema, and the release sign-off live in **[`security-review.md`](security-review.md)**
— load it whenever the checklist below is not enough (auth, money/asset movement,
multi-tenant data, untrusted input, secrets/crypto, file upload, deserialization, a new
outbound call). Every case here is a `TC-<EPIC>.SEC-<n>` row in the canonical table
([`traceability.md`](traceability.md)).

- [ ] **Authn** — valid/invalid/expired credentials; session fixation; logout invalidates.
- [ ] **Authz** — every protected path tested as owner / other-user / anonymous; no horizontal or vertical privilege escalation.
- [ ] **Token storage & rotation** — at-rest location, expiry, refresh, revocation; no token in URL/log.
- [ ] **CSRF / SameSite** — state-changing request without/with forged token rejected; cookie flags asserted.
- [ ] **Replay / nonce** — a captured request replayed is rejected; nonce single-use.
- [ ] **Rate-limiting** — burst past the limit is throttled (429); limit resets.
- [ ] **RLS / data-isolation** — tenant A cannot read or mutate tenant B's rows.
- [ ] **Input injection** — SQLi, XSS (stored + reflected), command/path injection on every input; output rendered escaped.

> **Required when**: any feature with authentication, money/asset movement,
> multi-tenant data, or untrusted input. When the suite has ≥5 SEC cases, emit a
> standalone **`<feature>-security-test-cases.md`** alongside the epic file.

## Performance

Assert against an **SLA target**, not just a measured number — a green run with
no budget proves nothing.

- [ ] **Latency** — p50 / p95 / p99 vs budget (e.g. p95 read < 300 ms, write < 800 ms).
- [ ] **Throughput** — sustained req/s at target concurrency without error-rate climb.
- [ ] **Payload / cold start** — bundle size, first-load, cold-path budget.
- [ ] **Resource ceilings** — memory / CPU under load stays within limit.

The asserted SLA goes in the canonical table's **Perf** column.

> **Required when**: a user-facing latency expectation, a hot path, or a documented
> SLA exists. Default p95 budget if unstated: interactive < 1 s, background < 5 s.

---

## Accessibility

WCAG 2.1 AA as the floor.

- [ ] **Keyboard nav** — every action reachable and operable without a mouse; no trap.
- [ ] **Screen-reader labels** — controls, images, and live regions have accessible names.
- [ ] **Contrast** — text ≥ 4.5:1, large text / UI ≥ 3:1.
- [ ] **Focus order** — logical, visible focus ring; modal returns focus on close.

> **Required when**: any user-facing UI. A11Y cases are `TC-<EPIC>.A11Y-<n>`.

## UI / visual conformance to DESIGN.md + the shadcn standard

The visual contract has **two mandatory halves**: the repo's `DESIGN.md` (the
product's own spec) **and** the **shadcn standard** (the Koniverse UI component
standard, vendored by koni-setup for UI repos). A feature that "works" but drifts
from *either* is a defect. **Every UI-bearing case MUST pass gstack `/design-review`
against both** — this is a hard requirement, not advisory.

- [ ] **DESIGN.md conformance** — run gstack `/design-review` against the repo's
  `DESIGN.md` and confirm layout, spacing, type hierarchy, color tokens, component
  states (hover/focus/disabled/loading/empty/error), and motion match the spec.
- [ ] **shadcn conformance (MUST)** — the UI is built from **shadcn/ui primitives**
  (don't hand-roll a component shadcn already provides), uses the repo's **design
  tokens / theme** (Tailwind CSS variables + `components.json`, never ad-hoc hex/px
  or inline restyle that bypasses the token system), expresses variants with **`cva`
  + `cn()`** (not one-off className soup), and **preserves the Radix a11y** of the
  primitive (keyboard, focus, ARIA). The component contracts in the repo's
  `DESIGN.md` / design-spec name these shadcn primitives.
- [ ] **No AI-slop / off-system patterns** — flag generic or off-system UI (a
  re-invented button, a bespoke modal, a stray palette) that `/design-review` surfaces.
- [ ] **Static design lint green (when the repo has one)** — the deterministic
  subset (token-only colors — no inline hex / off-token `bg-[#…]`, typography,
  radius/spacing scale) is enforced by the repo's design-lint tests/script in the
  unit gate. **A design TC counts covered only when `/design-review` passes AND the
  static lint is green — the two together are the gate** (the ERP field rule);
  `/design-review` alone judges only what can't be grepped.
- [ ] **Deviations are failures** — each `DESIGN.md`-or-shadcn mismatch is logged
  against its TC-ID, not waved through.

> **Required when**: any UI changes. These are `TC-<EPIC>.UI-<n>` (or fold into the
> relevant `FUNC`/`A11Y` case) and are the **canonical UI-conformance criteria** the
> rest of koni-qc + the koni-harness Review stage point at. koni-qc does not eyeball
> pixels itself — it **delegates to gstack `/design-review`**; `DESIGN.md` + the shadcn
> standard are the source of truth. (A repo not built on shadcn substitutes its own
> declared component system in the shadcn slot; Koniverse UI repos default to shadcn.)

## Internationalization

- [ ] **Locale** — number / date / currency formatting per locale.
- [ ] **RTL** — layout mirrors for right-to-left scripts.
- [ ] **Encoding** — UTF-8 / emoji / multi-byte input round-trips intact.
- [ ] **Timezone** — display + storage correct across DST and offset boundaries.

> **Required when**: the product ships in >1 locale, or stores user-entered text /
> timestamps. (Native-language step text stays internal per RULE-13.)

---

## Reliability & resilience

Failure-mode tests — prove graceful degradation, not just the happy path.

- [ ] **Offline** — action while disconnected surfaces a clear state, no data loss.
- [ ] **Timeout** — slow dependency hits timeout → handled, not hung.
- [ ] **Retry / idempotency** — retried request does not double-apply.
- [ ] **Partial failure** — one leg of a multi-step op fails → consistent rollback or compensation.

> **Required when**: the feature spans a network call, multi-step transaction, or
> external dependency.

---

## Compatibility

A cross-platform / cross-browser matrix, not a single environment.

- [ ] **Browsers** — Chromium / Firefox / Safari (+ last-2-versions) per supported set.
- [ ] **Platforms** — `[extension]` / `[mobile]` / `[webapp]` / `[telegram]` variants run.
- [ ] **Viewport** — responsive breakpoints; touch vs pointer.

> **Required when**: the feature renders UI or runs across >1 surface. Use the
> platform-variant columns from [`traceability.md`](traceability.md).

---

## Observability

Assert that the system tells you what happened.

- [ ] **Logs** — key events logged at the right level; no secret leakage.
- [ ] **Metrics** — counters / latency emitted for the critical path.
- [ ] **Traces** — a request is traceable end-to-end across service boundaries.

> **Required when**: a service boundary, a money/asset path, or anything an
> on-call engineer must debug in production.
