# Test Cases — Customize Network (koni-qc pilot)

> **Load when**: you want a concrete end-to-end example of an authored suite.
> **Worked example** produced by `koni-qc` from a feature's requirements, shown
> as one flat document for readability — a real adoption splits it per the
> `test-cases/EPIC-CN/` directory layout of `test-organization.md` §1 (`index.md`
> frame + per-US row files; the single-file `EPIC-CN.md` shape shown here is
> legacy-accepted). It demonstrates the standard and the uplift over the hand-made
> `koni-docs.backup` `customize-network` suite (58 manual cases, ~70% happy-path,
> no TC IDs, no AC↔TC matrix, <5% NFR). The content (rows, matrix, sections) is
> identical in either container; the product (SubWallet) is not in this repo.

## Overview

### Scope

**In scope** — the *Customize Network* feature (extension + mobile): add a custom
RPC network manually, auto-detect chain metadata, edit, and delete.

**Out of scope** — the underlying chain connectivity library; built-in network
seeding; the provider-selector UI beyond "the new network appears" (its own suite).

### Acceptance criteria (derived from requirements)

- **AC-1** — Entering a reachable RPC URL auto-detects chain type (EVM/Substrate)
  and auto-fills name, native symbol, decimals, chain-id, block explorer.
- **AC-2** — The user can override any auto-filled field before saving.
- **AC-3** — Save persists the network; it then appears in the provider/selector.
- **AC-4** — An unreachable or invalid RPC is rejected with a clear error
  (*"Cannot connect to this provider"*); nothing is saved.
- **AC-5** — A network that already exists (same chain-id) is rejected as a
  duplicate.
- **AC-6** — A custom network can be edited and deleted; a built-in or
  currently-in-use network cannot be deleted.

### Goals — what running this suite proves

A user can safely add, override, persist, edit, and remove custom networks; bad
input fails closed; the form resists injection/SSRF; it degrades gracefully on
flaky networks; no duplicate or orphaned network state is created.

### Environment & test data

- **Env**: extension (Chrome/Firefox) + mobile (iOS/Android), staging build.
- **Fixtures** (reusable, seeded): `RPC_EVM_OK = https://rpc.evm-test.example`,
  `RPC_SUBSTRATE_OK = wss://rpc.dot-test.example`, `RPC_UNREACHABLE =
  https://10.255.255.1`, `RPC_MALFORMED = "ht!tp://nope"`, `NET_EXISTING` (a
  network already imported), `NAME_MAX` (64 chars), `NAME_OVER` (65 chars),
  `NAME_EMOJI = "Bố 🚀 net"`, `NAME_XSS = "<script>alert(1)</script>"`,
  `RPC_INTERNAL = http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data`.
- **Teardown**: delete any custom network a case created at end of run.

### Cadence & ownership

| Cadence | Test types | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Per-PR | smoke (`SMK`) | dev on PR |
| Per-release | functional + regression (`RC-`) + security | QA |
| Nightly | performance (`PERF`) | CI |

## Coverage matrix (AC ↔ TC)

Every AC has ≥1 positive **and** ≥1 negative **and** ≥1 boundary-or-edge case,
each filled by a **distinct** TC (no double-counting) — the check the manual
backup suite lacked entirely. No orphan AC; no orphan TC.

> **Single-feature suite → one US block.** This worked example is a single
> customize-network feature, so the matrix collapses to one story block and omits
> the per-US **Story** column that [`traceability.md`](traceability.md) shows for a
> multi-story epic. In a real `EPIC-NN.md` the matrix has a leading `Story` column
> (one block per US) and every TC carries `maps_to.us` — coverage is then measured
> per US (`test-organization.md` §0). Here every TC `maps_to.us: US-CN` (the
> customize-network story).

| AC | AC description | Positive | Negative | Boundary / edge | NFR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AC-1 | Auto-detect + auto-fill | TC-CN.FUNC-1, FUNC-2, SMK-1 | TC-CN.NEG-1 | TC-CN.EDGE-3 | TC-CN.PERF-1, A11Y-1 |
| AC-2 | Override fields | TC-CN.FUNC-3 | TC-CN.NEG-6 | TC-CN.BND-1, BND-2, EDGE-1 | TC-CN.SEC-1, A11Y-1 |
| AC-3 | Persist + appears in selector | TC-CN.FUNC-4, SMK-1, REG-1 | TC-CN.NEG-5 | TC-CN.EDGE-2 | — |
| AC-4 | Reject invalid / unreachable RPC | TC-CN.FUNC-1 (valid accepted) | TC-CN.NEG-1, NEG-2 | TC-CN.EDGE-3 | TC-CN.SEC-2 |
| AC-5 | Reject duplicate | TC-CN.SMK-1 (new accepted) | TC-CN.NEG-3 | TC-CN.BND-3 | — |
| AC-6 | Edit / delete rules | TC-CN.FUNC-5, FUNC-6 | TC-CN.NEG-4 | TC-CN.BND-4 | — |

**Every AC row has a distinct positive, negative, and boundary-or-edge TC** (AC-1,
AC-3, AC-4 use an EDGE case for the third slot — explicitly allowed by the
[`traceability.md`](traceability.md) "boundary-or-edge" rule). Each TC in the
matrix exists as a row in §Test scenarios (no orphan TC); each AC is covered (no
orphan AC). Regression baseline = the `RC-` set: **RC-1** (TC-CN.REG-1), run
every release.

## Open / deferred scenarios

- App-kill mid-Save durability (process crash between detect and persist) —
  deferred to a dedicated resilience pass (related to NEG-5).
- i18n: RTL rendering of the network name — deferred (tracked in `nfr.md` (the i18n section)).

## Self-grade vs `quality-bar.md`

**Band A — beat the manual backup (all must clear):**
- [x] Explicit TC IDs — `TC-CN.<TYPE>-<n>`
- [x] AC↔TC matrix — complete; every AC has a distinct pos + neg + boundary-or-edge; no orphans, no double-counting
- [x] ≥50% off-path — 6 NEG + 4 BND + 3 EDGE = 13 of 25 cases (52%) off-path
- [x] NFR present — SEC-1/2, PERF-1, A11Y-1
- [ ] Coverage % reported — **N/A for this authoring artifact** (execution item;
  satisfied at Execute when the run reports % by AC/type). The authoring AC↔TC
  matrix itself is the row above.
- [x] Test-data strategy — named reusable fixtures + teardown
- [x] Entry/exit criteria — `qc-workflow.md`; release gate on matrix + RC set
- [x] Test lifecycle — Open/deferred; deprecate-not-renumber per scheme
- [x] Risk-based order — Critical→Low priorities
- [x] Regression scope — `RC-1` baseline
- [x] Automation linkage — Covered-by column (`*.spec.ts` / `bench` handles)
- [ ] Real reports — **N/A for this authoring artifact** (all 25 rows are `Not
  Executed`); satisfied at the Execute stage when the koni-docs `test-report.md`
  is filled. Per `quality-bar.md`, the two execution-stage Band-A items (Real
  reports + Coverage % reported) are deferred-not-failed for an Author-mode suite.

**Band B — match the Koni-Finance standard:**
- [x] Rich per-TC metadata table (12 columns)
- [x] Dedicated security cases (SEC-1 XSS, SEC-2 SSRF; can emit a standalone `*-security-test-cases.md`)
- [x] Concrete reusable test data (fixtures block)
- [x] Execution instrumentation (Status + Perf + Side-effects + Covered-by)

**Band C — close its residual gaps:**
- [x] **Complete** AC↔TC matrix (Koni-Finance lacked this)
- [x] Env/fixtures playbook (Environment & test data)
- [x] a11y/i18n (A11Y-1, EDGE-1; i18n deferred-but-logged)
- [x] Perf SLA (PERF-1 p95 ≤ 2.0s — a target, not just a measurement)
- [x] Cadence (Cadence & ownership table)

**Pass rule** — clears all of Band A; demonstrably exceeds B and C. ✅ **PASS.**

## Before / after delta vs the manual backup

| Dimension | `koni-docs.backup` (manual) | This (koni-qc) |
|---|---|---|
| Test IDs | none (row # + name) | explicit `TC-CN.<TYPE>-<n>` |
| AC↔TC traceability | implicit (feature name) | **complete coverage matrix**, no orphans |
| Negative / boundary | ~25%, ad-hoc | NEG/BND/EDGE first-class (~50%) |
| Injection / security | absent | SEC-1 (XSS), SEC-2 (SSRF) |
| Concurrency / network-failure / durability | absent | EDGE-2 (double-save), EDGE-3 (flaky), NEG-5 (atomic save) |
| Non-functional | absent | PERF-1 (SLA), A11Y-1 |
| Test data | hardcoded, scattered | named reusable fixtures + teardown |
| Risk ordering | equal (row order) | Critical→Low |
| Regression scope | undefined | `RC-1` baseline |

58 shallow manual cases → **25 typed, traced, risk-ordered, edge/NFR/security-complete**
cases that pass koni-qc's own quality bar — the same feature, covered to a standard
the manual suite never reached, and to a completeness (full AC↔TC matrix) the
Koni-Finance production suite did not have either. A full production suite expands
each AC's partitions further per `test-design.md`; this pilot establishes the
shape and clears the bar.
