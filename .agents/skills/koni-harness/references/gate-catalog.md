# Gate catalog — the built-in checks

The gate is driven by `gates.conf`, a line-oriented config read by
`gate-runner.sh`. This file documents the eight built-in checks that ship in the
default `gates.conf`, the config grammar, and how to add your own check.

For how the runner is wired into git / Claude Code / Gemini / Codex, see
[`adapters.md`](adapters.md). For non-destructive install, see
[`adoption.md`](adoption.md).

## Phases and severities

Every check is tagged with one or more **phases** and exactly one **severity**.

**Phases** (the `--phase` value the runner is invoked with):

| Phase | When it runs | Typical adapter |
|---|---|---|
| `work-commit` | An ordinary commit during development | git `pre-commit` |
| `release-commit` | A commit that ships a version (VERSION + CHANGELOG) | git `pre-commit` (the same hook; phase chosen by the caller) or a release script |
| `pre-push` | Before pushing to a remote | git `pre-push` |

**Severities** (what a *failing* check does):

| Severity | Effect |
|---|---|
| `block` | The runner exits non-zero → the commit/push is stopped. Fix and retry. |
| `warn` | The runner prints `WARN: <name>` and keeps going. **A warn never blocks** — its exit is unaffected. Repos opt a check up from `warn` to `block` once they run clean. |

The runner prints `PASS: <name>` for a check that passes, `BLOCK: <name>` for a
failing `block` check, and `WARN: <name>` for a failing `warn` check. (These are
plain text prefixes, not glyphs.) Only a failing `block` check changes the exit
code.

---

## Invoking the release-commit phase

The git hooks installed by `install-gate.sh` only ever run two phases:
`pre-commit` runs `--phase work-commit` and `pre-push` runs `--phase pre-push`.
**Nothing in the installed hooks runs `--phase release-commit`.** That is by
design — `release-commit` is a heavier gate meant to be run *explicitly* by your
release process or CI, right before you bump `VERSION` / tag a release:

```sh
sh .koni-harness/gate-runner.sh --phase release-commit
```

What that means for what fires automatically on a normal `git commit`:

| Check | Phases | Runs on every commit? |
|---|---|---|
| `version-phase` | `work-commit`, `release-commit` | **Yes** — both phases |
| `credential-scan` | `work-commit`, `pre-push` | **Yes** — on commit and on push |
| `changelog-anchor` | `release-commit` | No — release-commit only |
| `story-status` | `release-commit` | No — release-commit only |
| `story-lint` | `release-commit` | No — release-commit only |
| `lesson-capture` | `release-commit` | No — release-commit only |
| `design-first` | `release-commit` | No — release-commit only |
| `koni-docs-validate` | `release-commit` | No — release-commit only |

So `version-phase` — the critical 2-phase versioning gate — **does** run on
every commit through the `pre-commit` hook. The six release-commit-only checks
(`changelog-anchor`, `story-status`, `story-lint`, `lesson-capture`,
`design-first`, `koni-docs-validate`) do **not** fire from
an ordinary commit; they are opt-in at release time, run only when you (or CI)
invoke `--phase release-commit`. Installing the hooks does not, on its own,
enforce release-time checks.

## The eight built-in checks

### `version-phase`

- **What it asserts**: if `VERSION` is staged in this commit, a `CHANGELOG.md`
  must also be staged *and* the staged CHANGELOG must contain a `[<newver>]`
  section matching the new VERSION (literal match on `[<version>]`, searched in
  `docs/CHANGELOG.md` then `CHANGELOG.md`). If `VERSION` is not staged, the
  check passes immediately (an ordinary work commit is fine). An empty staged
  `VERSION` blocks.
- **Phase(s)**: `work-commit`, `release-commit`
- **Default severity**: `block`
- **Generalizes from**: Senti-Quant's `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` 2-phase
  versioning gate (a VERSION bump must carry its matching changelog section in
  the same commit).
- **`gates.conf` row**:
  ```
  version-phase        | checks/version-phase.sh            | work-commit,release-commit | block |
  ```

### `changelog-anchor`

- **What it asserts**: a `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (or root `CHANGELOG.md`) exists and
  contains an `[Unreleased]` anchor. Missing file or missing anchor blocks.
- **Phase(s)**: `release-commit`
- **Default severity**: `block`
- **Generalizes from**: koni-docs RULE-1 (the CHANGELOG `## [Unreleased]`
  surface that pending entries land under).
- **`gates.conf` row**:
  ```
  changelog-anchor     | checks/changelog-anchor.sh         | release-commit             | block |
  ```

### `credential-scan`

- **What it asserts**: the staged **added** lines (`git diff --cached -U0`,
  `+`-prefixed, excluding the `+++` header) contain no high-confidence secret.
  It blocks on three patterns only: a PEM `BEGIN … PRIVATE KEY` block, an
  `AKIA…` AWS access-key id (`AKIA` + 16 upper/digits), and a quoted long
  secret-like assignment (`api_key` / `secret` / `token` `=`/`:` a 24+ char
  value). Low-confidence heuristics are deliberately out of scope to avoid
  false positives. A repo can add `.koni-harness/secret-allow` — one substring
  per line; matching added lines are filtered out before scanning.
- **Allowlist sharp edge**: the allowlist is a **substring** filter, so each entry
  must be the **full distinctive secret value** you are exempting — never a short
  common token. An entry like `api_key` would strip *every* added line containing
  that substring (including a line that also carries a real leaked value), silently
  defeating the scan. Allowlist the whole value (e.g. the exact test fixture
  string), not a generic word.
- **Phase(s)**: `work-commit`, `pre-push`
- **Default severity**: `block`
- **Generalizes from**: Senti-Quant's credential-isolation discipline.
- **`gates.conf` row**:
  ```
  credential-scan      | checks/credential-scan.sh          | work-commit,pre-push       | block |
  ```

### `story-status`

- **What it asserts**: no story file under `docs/sprints/stories/` is marked
  `status: done` while it still has an unchecked acceptance-criteria/task box
  (`- [ ]`). The status match is tolerant (case-insensitive, allows surrounding
  markdown emphasis like `**status:** done`). Missing stories directory → pass.
- **Phase(s)**: `release-commit`
- **Default severity**: `warn`
- **Generalizes from**: the koni-docs sprint model (a `done` story should have
  all AC checked).
- **`gates.conf` row**:
  ```
  story-status         | checks/story-status-consistency.sh | release-commit             | warn  |
  ```

### `story-lint`

- **What it asserts**: every US story's frontmatter is **complete and true at
  write time** — mandatory fields present (`id · title · epic · status ·
  priority · points · sprint · assignee · commit · created · updated`, +
  `version_shipped` when done); `points` a positive integer (Fibonacci for a
  single-round story; a consolidated story carries the sum of its rounds); `id`
  matches the filename prefix; the `sprint:` file exists **and did not end
  before `created:`** (the "filed into a closed sprint" bug); `status: done` ⇒
  a real `commit:` (`pending` tolerated only while `updated:` is today — the
  same-day backfill window); stories created on/after 2026-07-04 carry a
  `Lessons applied:` line — the **read half** of the lessons loop (cited
  sections or an explicit none-with-reason). Missing stories directory → pass.
- **Phase(s)**: `release-commit`
- **Default severity**: `block` — unlike style checks, an incomplete story is
  never a judgment call.
- **Generalizes from**: the Koni-Skills honesty audit (CONTEXT D32: 8 stories
  shipped without `points:`, 12 filed into an ended sprint; LESSONS §12). On
  its **first run** it caught the same drift from two months earlier (7
  v0.2.0 stories, D34) — the class recurs whenever it isn't gated.
- **Self-test**: `__tests__/story-lint-test.sh` (16 assertions freezing the
  D32 failure classes + the D35 read-evidence rule).
- **`gates.conf` row**:
  ```
  story-lint           | checks/story-lint.sh               | release-commit             | block |
  ```

### `lesson-capture`

- **What it asserts**: a **task-bearing release commit records a lesson
  verdict** — the write half of the lessons loop
  ([`agentic-loop-standard.md`](agentic-loop-standard.md)). If the staged diff
  touches anything outside `docs/` (a development task), the commit must stage
  **either** a `LESSONS.md` change (a staged *deletion* does not count) **or**
  an **added line** `Lessons: none new — <reason>` in this commit's staged .md/.mdx
  diff (the honest no-lesson verdict; em-dash form, the reason is mandatory and
  may not contain `<` — placeholder quotes never count, and pre-existing lines
  never count, so one old example cannot neutralize the gate). Known residual
  (adversarial-only): a pure **rename to `.md`** of a file whose old content
  held a concrete verdict line surfaces as all-added lines and would pass —
  no cheap POSIX fix; accepted and recorded here rather than hidden. Docs-only commits (backfills, sprint
  bookkeeping) are exempt; outside a git repo / nothing staged → pass. The
  check enforces **that the verdict was recorded, never which way it went** —
  "was a lesson learned?" stays human judgment (forced lessons breed filler).
- **Phase(s)**: `release-commit`
- **Default severity**: `block` — silence is the failure mode; the verdict
  costs one honest line.
- **Generalizes from**: the Koni-Skills lessons loop (CONTEXT D26 named the
  write step; D35 made both halves always-on after the user rule "luôn ghi
  LESSONS khi hoàn thành nhiệm vụ"). The read half is enforced by
  `story-lint`'s `Lessons applied:` rule on new stories.
- **Self-test**: `__tests__/lesson-capture-test.sh` (12 assertions: exemptions,
  both verdict forms, unstaged-verdict and missing-reason failures).
- **`gates.conf` row**:
  ```
  lesson-capture       | checks/lesson-capture.sh           | release-commit             | block |
  ```

### `design-first`

- **What it asserts**: UI code complies with the repo's design contract **at
  write time, not review time** — the other half of preventing UI rework
  ([`agentic-loop-standard.md`](agentic-loop-standard.md) design-first
  callout). A release commit staging UI source (`*.tsx *.jsx *.vue *.svelte
  *.css *.scss`), in a repo that has `DESIGN.md` (root or `docs/`), must also
  stage an **added** `Design applied: <sections + primitives + tokens>` line
  in a markdown file. Same anti-gaming mechanics as `lesson-capture`:
  added-lines only, placeholder forms containing `<` never count, loop-free
  path handling — and the same **documented residuals**: a rename-to-`.md`
  carrying an old citation passes (adversarial-only), and the extension
  boundary is deliberate — styling embedded in `.ts` template literals is
  invisible to this gate (adding `.ts` would false-positive all server code);
  `/design-review` remains the judge of what a grep cannot see. Deletion-only
  UI commits are exempt (`--diff-filter=d` — removing UI needs no citation).
  No `DESIGN.md` → pass (nothing to comply with; on a UI repo
  that absence is a koni-setup gap, not a license). `/design-review` at
  Review then **confirms** conformance rather than discovering violations.
- **Phase(s)**: `release-commit`
- **Default severity**: `block` — a stated design rule violated in shipped UI
  is never a judgment call.
- **Generalizes from**: the Koniverse UI rework loop the user named ("làm đi
  làm lại phần giao diện") — CONTEXT D36; the citation-evidence pattern of
  D35 (LESSONS §14/§15).
- **Self-test**: `__tests__/design-first-test.sh` (11 assertions, bash + dash).
- **`gates.conf` row**:
  ```
  design-first         | checks/design-first.sh             | release-commit             | block |
  ```

### `koni-docs-validate`

- **What it asserts**: when `koni-docs` is resolvable, runs
  `npx --no-install koni-docs validate --docs-path docs/` (ID graph + FR refs).
  It **skip-passes** (exit 0, no block) when any of these is true: there is no
  `docs/` directory, `npx` is unavailable, or `koni-docs` is resolvable
  **neither locally nor globally/ambiently**. Note that the probe
  (`npx --no-install koni-docs --version`) resolves *up* the directory tree and
  to *global* installs, so a repo with no `koni-docs` dependency of its own can
  still resolve an ambient/global `koni-docs` — and if any ambient `koni-docs`
  is on `PATH` or otherwise resolvable, the check runs against it rather than
  skip-passing. It never triggers a network install.
- **Phase(s)**: `release-commit`
- **Default severity**: `warn` (warn first; a repo opts into `block` once its
  docs validate clean)
- **Generalizes from**: the koni-docs `validate` CLI.
- **`gates.conf` row**:
  ```
  koni-docs-validate   | checks/koni-docs-validate.sh        | release-commit             | warn  |
  ```

### `tests` (passthrough)

- **What it asserts**: runs a repo-provided command via `passthrough.sh` and
  passes its exit code through. The command comes from the `arg` column — here
  `npm test`. An empty `arg` makes the check a no-op (skip-pass).
- **Phase(s)**: `pre-push`
- **Default severity**: `block`
- **Generalizes from**: Senti-Quant CI (`tsc --noEmit` / `npm test`).
- **`gates.conf` row**:
  ```
  tests                | checks/passthrough.sh              | pre-push                   | block | npm test
  ```
- **Unit-coverage variant**: to enforce the koni-qc `unit-coverage.md` bar as a
  gate, add a second `passthrough` row whose `arg` runs the repo's coverage command
  with a threshold (it fails non-zero below the bar), e.g.
  ```
  unit-coverage        | checks/passthrough.sh              | work-commit                | warn  | npm run test:cov
  ```
  where `test:cov` is e.g. `vitest run --coverage --coverage.thresholds.lines=80 --coverage.thresholds.branches=80` (or `jest --coverage --coverageThreshold=…`, `pytest --cov --cov-fail-under=80`). Start at `warn`, graduate to `block` once the repo is clean. This is the deterministic backing for the Self-verify unit-coverage gate.

---

## Config grammar

`gates.conf` is line-oriented and pipe-delimited — no YAML, no `yq`, zero parser
dependency. One check per line:

```
name | script | phases(csv) | severity | arg
```

- **`name`** — display name printed by the runner.
- **`script`** — path to the check. A relative path is resolved against the
  runner's own directory (so `checks/foo.sh` resolves next to `gate-runner.sh`);
  an absolute path (`/…`) is used as-is.
- **`phases`** — comma-separated list of `work-commit` / `release-commit` /
  `pre-push`. The check runs only when the runner's `--phase` matches one of
  them. Whitespace inside the CSV is stripped.
- **`severity`** — `block` or `warn`.
- **`arg`** — a single optional argument passed to the check (e.g. the command
  for `passthrough.sh`). May be empty.

Parsing rules:

- Lines that are blank or start with `#` (after trimming leading whitespace) are
  skipped.
- Surrounding whitespace on each field is trimmed.
- A final line **without a trailing newline is still read** — the runner's read
  loop is `while IFS='|' read … || [ -n "$name" ]`, so a config that ends
  without a newline does not silently drop its last check.

---

## Adding a custom check

1. Write a script that reads the staged state and exits `0` (pass) or `1`
   (fail). Keep it deterministic and grep-based — see the
   [engineering principles](agentic-loop-standard.md#harness-engineering-principles).
   Drop it in `.koni-harness/checks/your-check.sh` (in the consumer repo) and
   make it executable.
2. Add a row to `.koni-harness/gates.conf` pointing at it, choosing its phases
   and severity:
   ```
   your-check | checks/your-check.sh | work-commit | warn |
   ```
3. Dry-run to confirm it is wired:
   `sh .koni-harness/gate-runner.sh --phase work-commit --dry-run`

The runner is the only orchestrator — checks never call each other. New checks
should start at `warn` and graduate to `block` once the repo runs clean.

> **Calling convention**: the runner always invokes a check as
> `sh <script> "<arg>"` — your check receives **exactly one positional argument**,
> which is the empty string when the `arg` column is blank. A `set -eu` check that
> shifts positionals should default it (`a=${1:-}`), not assume it is absent.

> **Path foot-gun**: a relative `script` is resolved against the **runner's**
> directory, *not* against the `gates.conf` location or the cwd. So a custom
> check must live in `.koni-harness/checks/` (next to the runner) or be named by
> an absolute path. If you test with `--config ./elsewhere/gates.conf`, a
> relative `checks/foo.sh` there will be looked up next to `gate-runner.sh`, not
> next to your config — use an absolute path in that case.
